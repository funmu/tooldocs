# ToolDocs
My collection of notes, references, and documents related to Development Tools.

Over the past few years, I had been using assorted set of development tools
 to build software, creative work, and use it for personal purposes. While
 the tools used in the professional setting were documented and maintained,
 those are owned by the respective professional organizations. This repository
 will contain my personal notes.

Separately, I had been coaching young kids to develop an understanding of
 computers and programming. I will include notes on tools and tutorials I
 refer these early learners to.

The [scripts](./scripts) folder has a few utility scripts. More to come there. It assumes a Mac/Bash shell development environment.

## General Development
First get started with general [Development Tools](docs/dev_tools.md).
There are a variety of [open source tools](docs/oss_tools.md) that
may take long time to learn, but can significantly smaller compared to
creating such tools on our own.

## Web Development Tools
See [Web Design Tools](docs/web_design.md).

## Javascript / Node Tools
