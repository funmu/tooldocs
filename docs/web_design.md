# Web Design
Since its arrival in the 1990s, Web has been revolutionary. It all started with
simple HTML files rendered as pages on the browsers. Over time several
other files including CSS, JS, etc., have joined the party. There are now 100s
of frameworks, libraries, and tools that ease the job of creating compelling experiences.
Here are a few such items listed.
