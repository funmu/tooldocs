# Tools for 3D Printing

3D Printing is fascinating. One can create customized items using 3D Printers. 

A variety of tools are availabe for modeling, optimizing, and preparing the 3D Prints.

## 3D Workflow
There are four distict major steps in the 3D Printing workflow. 
Each step and the entire workflow may need multiple iterations to get the design done.

The four major steps are:

1. **Design** the component using 3D modeling software (using Tinkercad)
2. **Slice** the model using slicers with printer specific configuration (using OrcaSlicer)
3. **Print** the design to check on the final outputs
4. **Inspect** the outputs and refine as needed

## Design Tools

All 3D work starts with design work. Here one takes the ideas and shapes them into a visual representation of what they want to produce.

[TinkerCAD](http://tinkercad.com/) is a simple 3D Modeling Software. It is easy to get started. 
One starts with a simple canvas, adds objects, and create new composite objects.
The objects can be resized, aligned, scaled, rotated, etc. 
The final object can be exported into interchangeable formats for further processing.

## Printing Tools

Once a design is ready, next is the step to prepare the objects for the 3D Printer. We will use 3D Slicer software for this. 
There are a range of slicers availabe. Fortunately many of these started from open source tools and have evolved over time. 
I use [OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer) for preparing and slicing the object to feed into the printer.

## Other Tools

- [Vector Magic](https://vectormagic.com/) - for extractign shapes from given images
- [G and M Codes in gcode](https://www.cnccookbook.com/g-code-m-code-command-list-cnc-mills/) - useful for instructing the 3D Printer on movements
