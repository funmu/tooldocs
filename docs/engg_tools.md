# Engineering Tools
Tools simplify the work of designing, developing, testing, and releasing products.
Working with JavaScript and web apps requires a specialized set of tools.
Some of the tools are introduced and discussed here.

## Repository

[Git site](http://git-scm.com) is a great version control software tool.
Thanks to [Github](https://github.com) and
[Atlassian BitBucket](https://www.BitBucket.com) we have good distributed repository management tools as well.

[Git Cheatsheet](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html) provides visual way to understand Git commands.

## Grunt

 - [Grunt Local](https://gruntjs.com/) - JavaScript task runner with grunt runtime support.
 - [Grunt CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-cli) command line tool for grunt processing

 - [Grunt sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-sass) for compiling SCSS files
 - [JIT Grunt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jit-grunt) for just in time grunt loading and execution
 - [Time Measurement for Grunt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jit-grunt) measures time  
 required to run automation with Grunt
 - [Load Grunt Tasks with Globbing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/load-grunt-tasks) for loading multiple files using globbing patterns

 - [Grunt Watch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-watch) watches for file changes and automates code generation for seeing the website in a browser
- [Grunt Browser Sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-browser-sync) helps to keep the browser and app connected during changes

- Variety of Tools for compressing and optimizing HTML/CSS/JS using Grunt
  - [Image Minification](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-imagemin) for compressing images
  - [CSS Minification](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-cssmin
  - [Concat Files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-concat)
  - [Use Minimization](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-usemin)
  - [HTML Minimization](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-htmlmin)
  - [Uglify / Scramble code](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-uglify)
  - [Filemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-filerev) - Revise file to invalidate caches

Lots of resources are on the internet for using Javascript to autmoate builds.
Here is [a tutorial on Grunt based build script](http://www.sitepoint.com/writing-awesome-build-script-grunt/) and another [guide to automate with grunt](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-command-line-for-web-design-automation-with-grunt--cms-23454)


## Gulp
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - JavaScript task runner with grunt runtime support
that expresses steps as a Javascript code.
- [Gulp CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) command line tool for grunt processing
- [Gulp sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass) for compiling SCSS files
- [Gulp Flatmap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-flatmap) runs same process through a stream for a file

- [File Deletion Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/del)
- [Gulp Imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-imagemin)
- [Gulp Usemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-usemin)
- [Gulp Htmlmin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-htmlmin)
- [Gulp Uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify)
- [Gulp Revision](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rev)
- [Gulp Clean CSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-clean-css)

Again there are a lot of resources for Gulp based automation.
Here is [an introduction to Gulp](http://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-gulp-js/),
and another
[guide to automate with gulp](https://markgoodyear.com/2014/01/getting-started-with-gulp/).

There is also tutorial on [building with gulp](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/06/building-with-gulp/) along with [automation guide with gulp](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-command-line-for-web-design-automation-with-gulp--cms-23642)
