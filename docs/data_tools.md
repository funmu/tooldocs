All servers mostly maintain state required for future processing of events.
Such data may be in any format including files, structured and unstructured datasets

[MongoDB](https://mongodb.org) is one such object relational database that is widely used.
[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) is the Javascript library to access and work with Mongo.
