# Computer Science Foundations

A variety of ideas in math, physics, etc. have influenced the creation of Computer Science.
Thousands of algorithms and concepts are in use. This page will track some of these concepts.

## Algorithms

## Distributed Systems
- [Hashing Algorithms] are fundamental for distribution of load, be it in data structures
or across many machines in a distributed environment.
- [Consistent Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing) provides a
mechanism to build up simple way to map n keys to m buckets (or clusters). With addition or removal,
only a minimal number (n/m) of the keys will require movement.
