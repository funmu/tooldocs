# Development Tools

For all programming and design work we need a set of tools. It doesn't matter
what language or operating system one uses. Following provides a link to a set
of tools and related tutorials.

## Repository Tools
All creative work needs a repository for safekeeping.

[Github](https://github.com) offers a simple cloud repository for public and private use.
See [Github tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) for more.

[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) is a convenient desktop tool for
 accessing and using git repositories.

[Github Pages](https://gitpages.com) helps you to use git to host simple HTML webpages. 
  This can be a starting play, provided you know a bit of HTML, css, and JavaScript.
 
## Alternate Repositories
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.com) is another repository management site.

## Editors
For a long time I had used [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com) as my repository.
And starting in 2020, I also had begun using [Atom](https://Atom.io) which is Simple
and works with Git repositories as well, improving the workflow.

I hear other developers rave about [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com).

And then there is a good old [GNU emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/).

## Documentation

[Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) offers quick tutorials on **Markdown**,
 a simplified version of html that is easy to learn and use for development documentation.
